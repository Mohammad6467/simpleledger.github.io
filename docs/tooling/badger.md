Badger is a secure identity vault for Bitcoin Cash. It allows you to hold BCH & tokens, and serves as your bridge to decentralized applications (dapps).

Bitcoin Cash and tokens enable an entirely new dimension to the web with micro-payments, smart-assets, decentralized exchanges, distributed autonomous organizations and much more.

Badger is your identity on this new web. You can pay for premium content, run smart contracts and experience dapps seemlessly and trust free.

Powered by BITBOX, Badger is 100% non-custodial. Your private keys never leave your computer.
