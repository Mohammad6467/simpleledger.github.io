Bitcoin.com Mint arose from the brainchild of Pitico, a team of developers who competed in a recent SLP hackathon. They created a web app that lets users create their own tokens, an innovation which secured them third place in the competition. It was then acquired by Bitcoin.com and developed into Bitcoin.com Mint. 

It is a non-custodial web wallet that allows users to send and receive SLP, create new tokens, and perform dividend payments.
